# NetworkSecurity
This repository showcases my cybersecurity home lab projects, which are a collection of hands-on experiments, labs, and write-ups Iâ€™ve built to explore security concepts. Everything here runs in a self-contained environment (virtual machines, Docker, and other lab setups), so I can safely simulate attacks, defenses, and monitoring without touching production systems.
